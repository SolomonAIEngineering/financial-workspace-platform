# DonutChart Component

The `DonutChart` is a circular chart with a hole in the center that displays data as proportional segments, similar to a pie chart. It's particularly effective for showing the composition of a whole and the relative size of its parts. The component supports customizable colors, tooltips, and interactive features.

## Component Props

## Usage Example

```tsx
<Canvas>
  <Story name="Default">
    <DonutChart 
      data={[
        { name: "Category A", value: 30 },
        { name: "Category B", value: 25 },
        { name: "Category C", value: 20 },
