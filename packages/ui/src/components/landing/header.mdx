# Header Component

The `Header` component is designed for landing pages, providing a navigation header at the top of the page. It typically includes the company logo, navigation links, and call-to-action buttons like "Sign Up" or "Log In". The component is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes with mobile menu options.

## Component Props

<Canvas of={Header.Default} />

<Controls />

## Usage Example

Here's a basic usage example of the `Header`:

```tsx
<Canvas>
  <Canvas of={Header.Default}>
    <Header
      logo="/logo.svg"
      logoAlt="Company Logo"
      navLinks={[
        { label: "Features", href: "#features" },
        { label: "Pricing", href: "#pricing" },
        { label: "About", href: "#about" },
        { label: "Contact", href: "#contact" }
      ]}
      callToAction={{
        primary: { label: "Sign Up", href: "/signup" },
        secondary: { label: "Log In", href: "/login" }
      }}
    />
  </Canvas>
</Canvas>
