# PlannerToolbar Component

The `PlannerToolbar` component provides a control bar for the planner interface with tools for navigation, view switching, and appointment creation. It typically includes date controls, view toggles (day/week/month), resource filters, and an "Add Appointment" button to enhance the planner's usability.

## Component Props

<Controls />

## Usage Example

Here's a basic usage example of the `PlannerToolbar`:

```tsx
<Canvas>
  <Story name="Default">
    <PlannerToolbar
      currentDate={new Date(2023, 5, 15)}
      onCurrentDateChange={(date) => console.log("Date changed:", date)}
      onViewChange={(viewName) => console.log("View changed:", viewName)}
      onAddAppointment={() => console.log("Add appointment clicked")}
      currentViewName="week"
      viewNames={["day", "week", "month"]}
    />
  </Story>
</Canvas>
```
